[IMPORTANT]
====
{alibabaclo} repository URLs are available from {scc}, but the packages and metadata are provided by Alibaba Cloud, not by {suse}.
====
endif::[]


[IMPORTANT]
====
The traditional stack is available on {alibabaclo}{nbsp}2 but it is not supported.
{alibabaclo}{nbsp}2 clients are only supported as Salt clients.
====

[WARNING]
====
Some {alibabaclo}{nbsp}2 instances will need two tries to register successfully.

== Add Software Channels

Before you register {alibabaclo} clients to your {productname} Server, you need to add the required software channels, and synchronize them.

ifeval::[{suma-content} == true]

The products you need for this procedure are:

[[alibaba-channels-wizard]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Alibaba Cloud Linux Products - WebUI
|===
| OS Version | Product Name
| {alibabaclo} 2 | Alibaba Cloud Linux 2 x86_64
|===

include::snippets/addchannels_vendor_webui.adoc[]

Alternatively, you can add channels at the command prompt.
The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[alibaba-channels-suma-cli]]
[cols="1,1", options="header"]
.Alibaba Cloud Linux Channels - CLI
|===
| OS Version | Base Channel
| {alibabaclo} 2 | alibaba-2-x86_64
|===

include::snippets/addchannels_vendor_cli.adoc[]

endif::[]


ifeval::[{uyuni-content} == true]
The channels you need for this procedure are:

[[alibaba-channels-uyuni-cli]]
[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
.Alibaba Cloud Linux Channels - CLI
|===

| OS Version
| Core Channel
| Client Channel

| {amazon} 2
| alibaba-2
| alibaba-2-uyuni-client

|===


include::snippets/addchannels_novendor_cli.adoc[]

[NOTE]
====
The client tools channel provided by [command]``spacewalk-common-channels`` is sourced from {uyuni} and not from {suse}.
====

== Check Synchronization Status

== Create an Activation Key

You need to create an activation key that is associated with your {alibabaclo} channels.

For more information on activation keys, see xref:client-configuration:activation-keys.adoc[].



== Register Clients

{alibabaclo} clients are registered in the same way as all other clients.

Some {alibabaclo}{nbsp}2 instances will fail to register on the first try due
to a bug in the {alibabaclo}{nbsp}2 image, where `python-urlgrabber3` is 
provided both as a pip (native Python) package and regular RPM package. This 
causes a conflict at the filesystem level and an error when you first try to 
register. If your instance is based on one of the affected image versions, you 
should try to register the client for a second time before reporting a bug.

For more information, see xref:client-configuration:registration-overview.adoc[].
