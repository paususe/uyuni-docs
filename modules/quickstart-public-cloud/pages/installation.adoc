= Installation

Public Cloud providers pre-install {productname}, so you do not need to perform any installation steps.
However, {productname} Server needs to be registered with {scc} to receive updates before you can sign in.
For detailed instructions on registering {productname} to {scc}, see xref:installation:server-setup.adoc[].

When you have registered, all {sle} modules will be activated.
You will also need to activate the Public Cloud module:

```
# SUSEConnect -p sle-module-public-cloud/15.1/x86_64
```

// Check this. LKB 2020-03-06
For more information on activating public clouds, see xref:installation:pubcloud-setup.adoc[].

A {productname} administrator account is created by default.
You need this account to access configuration settings in the public cloud provider interface.
The username and password varies depending on your provider.

.Default Administrator Account Details
[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
| Provider              | Default Username  | Default Password
| Amazon EC2            | ``admin``         | ``<instance-ID>``
| Google Compute Engine | ``admin``         | ``<instance-ID>``
| Microsoft Azure       | ``admin``         |``<instance-name>-suma``
|===

[IMPORTANT]
====
When you have logged in to the administrator account for the first time, change the default password to protect your account.

Add the required software products to your client, and schedule a repository synchronization.

.Procedure: Adding the openSUSE Channels

. At the command prompt on the {productname} Server, as root, install the [systemitem]``spacewalk-utils`` package:
+
----
zypper in spacewalk-utils
----
. Add the openSUSE channels.
+
----
spacewalk-common-channels \
opensuse_leap15_1 \
opensuse_leap15_1-non-oss \
opensuse_leap15_1-non-oss-updates \
opensuse_leap15_1-updates \
opensuse_leap15_1-uyuni-client
----

. Synchronize the new custom channels.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need all the new channels fully synchronized before bootstrapping any openSUSE client.
openSUSE channels can be very large.
Synchronization can sometimes take several hours.
====

To synchronize, navigate to menu:Software[Manage > Channels], and for each channel you created, click it and:

. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Repositories`` tab.
. Navigate to the [guimenu]``Sync`` sub-tab, and click btn:[Sync Now] to begin synchronization immediately.

You can also schedule synchronization from this screen.

If you are using {ubuntu} or {rhel} clients, you will need to set up custom repositories and channels.
